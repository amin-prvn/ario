# Ario - Python Lightweight Micro Framework
 > flask-based framework which is working with jinja2 and wrekzeug

This framework has been developed by Wish Team for web development purpose. This project is maintained by this team and hope make web development easier and faster.

## Motivation

The main concept of this framework is like flask. but it's only work like a dispatcher and you could easily use any library you want. you are not dependant to any 3rd specific libraries and also you do not have any regex in matching for your url which may cause ReDos to your system. you could specify the result of your response with just a decorator like ```@html``` or ```@jinja``` which is help for focusing on your development only.
